# Fiverr Buyer Request Checker

## Hi I build script to check if any buyer's request is available in Fiverr

Am Freelancer in Fiverr

check out <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/rinshinjalal">My Fiverr Profile</a> 

every day, every hour or every minute I checks buyer's request to get clients

I got bored by doing this

so I build a Web Scrapper with python to scrape the number of buyers request available

This scripts runs a script every 5 minute to check using schedule library

if any buyer's request it will message me `discord`
